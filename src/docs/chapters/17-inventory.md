## Inventory

The inventory feature introduce a new dependency inside the GameObject itself.

The InventoryObject, we are going to build, is a GameObject that will display
object the player has collected during the game, and display a max of 4 items in
the bottom right corner of the display.

The 4 items are displayed into a group of placeholder materialized by some graphic squares.
Gray ones are the available ones, and gold one is the active one.

2. The current active item is highlighted with a gold squared selector,
